Community Elections Resources and Polling Tool

Provide information on local elections, politicians, issues, and political outcomes. Visualize and share results.

Election information should be available to citizens in an easy to understand, fun to explore, and overall interesting way so that our community can better understand itself and its political past, present, and future.

#### Election Information

Larimer County provides information about elections at a precinct level, but the information is provided as a table of statistics. We are striving to improve the explorability of the data by building a website that lets Larimer County citizens view results on a map, compare precincts, and discover ways to reach out to elected officials.

#### Detailed Project Requirements

1. Show election information on a heat map of precincts in Larimer County.
2. Display all election outcomes for a precinct on the same page.
3. Allow different "views" of the data to be shared via hyperlinks.

## Getting Started

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](vue-webpack) and [docs for vue-loader](vue-loader-docs).

### Initial Steps

These steps only need to be performed once.

#### Verify Required Applications

This project is confirmed to work with a minimum of `node 6.11.3` and `npm@3.10.10`. If you do not wish to install the minimum [version of Node][node-releases] system-wide, you have a couple of options:
- [nvm (Node Version Manager)][nvm] **(recommended)** allows you to use multiple versions of Node and `npm` on the same machine. Once you have followed the installation instructions, run:
    ```bash
    nvm install
    ```
    ...to automatically set the appropriate versions for this project.
- [Docker][docker] is a more complex alternative that will not be covered here, but feel free to use it or any other method you want.

#### Dependencies/Packages

Install `npm` dependencies:

``` bash
npm install
```

#### Set the API Source

In *src/config.js*, uncomment the applicable option (and comment the other two) for `API_LOCATION`:

| Option                                 | Scenario                                                                                     |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `http://localhost:5000`                | Front **AND** back end development (be sure to [start the Python server][backend-serve] first)   |
| `https://cerp-code-foco.herokuapp.com` | **Front** end development                                                                        |
| `''`                                   | Building for **production**. *DON'T FORGET TO CHANGE CONFIG TO THIS IF BUILDING FOR PRODUCTION.* |

## Developing

Once you have completed the initial setup steps above, follow these instructions to start developing.

### Start the Server

To start a local web server with hot reload (browser will refresh automatically when files are changed) at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080):

``` bash
npm run dev
```

### Running Tests

Several commands exist for periodically running various tests on the code:

- **Unit:** `npm run unit`
- **e2e:** `npm run e2e`
- **All:** `npm test`

### Building and Testing

Building the project is a step for individuals responsible for updating the production environment. Before running these steps, please be sure you have cloned [CERP-backend][backend] as the build expects the directory.

To periodically build the project for production with minification:

```bash
npm run build
```

Or, to build for production and view the bundle analyzer report:

```bash
npm run build --report
```
